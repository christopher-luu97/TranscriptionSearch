# Offline Vector Database for Search

## Description

This repository contains code for reverse engineering [Huberman Transcripts](https://www.hubermantranscripts.com) to create an offline version. The main intent is to provide users with an offline vector database that they can use to perform searches independently.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to enable users to have access to the Huberman Transcripts data locally, allowing them to build and maintain their own vector database. This offline database will facilitate quick and efficient search operations.

## Features

- Reverse engineering of Huberman Transcripts website.
- Creation of an offline version of the data.
- Search functionality using a locally hosted vector database.
